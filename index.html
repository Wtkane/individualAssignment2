        <p> I recently traveled to Italy in the winter of 2023 and wanted to share my 
            experiences with others who were thinking about visiting! Italy is a 
            beautiful country and I hope everyone gets the chance to visit at some point
            during their life. This website documents my experiences in the three 
            distinct Italian cities of Rome, Florence, and Venice. These cities are 
            unique and brimming with culture. I hope you are able to learn about 
            Italian culture and hope it inspires you to plan your visit!</p>
